About the multi container app that is deployed:
 It consists of a Python app which maintains a counter in a Redis instance and increments the counter whenever you visit it.

Steps taken:
1. Created a three instances in docker playground - 1 master and 2 worker nodes

2. ran the following command in master node to initialize the cluster/swarm:
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.28

3. ran following command on each worker node to join the worker node to master:
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-57ntq4fscpj8928t9lefe4wp2nm3ikvo7vfq5y8r1k4bgp030q-apy4ub6klyu08yl60k20ydp44 192.168.0.28:2377

4. ran following command on master node to check all the nodes
docker node ls

5. Setting up docker registry on master node(throwaway registry)
docker service create --name registry --publish published=5000,target=5000 registry:2

6. Started the multicontainer(web+reddis) app with following command:
docker-compose up -d

7. push genrerated images to registry
docker-compose push

8. Now deploy the stack to the swarm - this deploys the multi container app to all the nodes
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml stackdemo

9.Check that itâ€™s running with:
 docker stack services stackdemo

10. access any node in the swarm on port 8000 and get routed to the app:
curl http://address-of-other-node:8000

11. Create persistent volume for redis instances

docker service create -d --replicas=4 --name redis-persistent-service --mount source=myvol2,target=/app redis:alpine
